## Exporting Data in ROS Bag File Format

Recording data to ROS bag files is a crucial technique for capturing raw sensor outputs for later analysis, debugging, or replication of specific scenarios in ROS environments. This section outlines how to record and utilize ROS bag files using the ROS 2 command line tools and utilities.

### Setup and Recording

#### 1. **Prepare Your Environment** (Optional):
   - Ensure that your ROS environment is correctly set up and sourced before starting the recording. This preparation involves sourcing your ROS installation and workspace configuration.
   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
   source ~/ros2_ws/install/local_setup.bash
   ```

#### 2. **Start the Camera Node**:
   - Launch the RealSense camera node to begin streaming data:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py
   ```
   - This step initializes the camera and makes its data streams available on various ROS topics.

#### 3. **Begin Recording Data**:
Open a new Terminal Tab.
   - Use the `ros2 bag record` command to start recording the desired topics into a bag file. Specify the topics you wish to record, typically including depth and color image streams.
   ```bash
   ros2 bag record -o realsense_data /camera/camera/depth/image_rect_raw /camera/camera/color/image_raw
   ```
   - The `-o` option specifies the output directory and filename prefix for the bag files. In this case `realsense_data` is the file type and `/camera/camera/depth/image_rect_raw` and `/camera/camera/color/image_raw` are the topics being recorded.

### Managing Recorded Data

#### 1. **Check the Recorded Bag File**:
   - After completing the recording (which you can stop by pressing `Ctrl+C`), verify the content of your bag file to ensure it contains the expected data.
   ```bash
   ros2 bag info realsense_data
   ```

#### 2. **Play Back the Recorded Data**:
   - To replay the recorded data for analysis or visualization, use the following command to play the bag file:
   ```bash
   ros2 bag play realsense_data
   ```
   - This command will republish the data on the same topics as recorded, allowing you to view or analyze the data as if it were being streamed live from the camera.

### Notes

- **Storage Considerations**: ROS bag files can grow significantly in size depending on the data rate and recording duration. Ensure adequate storage space is available and manage file sizes by controlling the recording duration and data streams.

## Exporting Depth Data to CSV File Format

This section describes how to create a custom ROS 2 package named `realsense_exporter` and implement a Python node within it that subscribes to depth image data from a RealSense camera and exports it to a CSV file. The data is saved in a structured format with each row containing the x and y pixel coordinates and the corresponding depth value. These steps can be followed for any package of your liking (simply chose your own package name). 

##### Firstly, assure that the RealSense Camera node `ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py` is running then open a new terminal tab.

### Setup and Node Implementation

#### 1. **Create ROS 2 Package**:
   - Navigate to your ROS 2 workspace source directory and create a new package.
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   ```
   ```bash
   ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy sensor_msgs cv_bridge -- realsense_exporter
   ```

#### 2. **Implement the Node**:
   - Navigate to the package directory and create the Python script for the node.
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src/realsense_exporter/realsense_exporter
   ```
   ```bash
   nano depth_to_csv.py
   ```
   - Paste the following Python script into the file. This script sets up a ROS 2 node that listens to depth images and writes select depth data to a CSV file:

```bash
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from sensor_msgs.msg import Image
from cv_bridge import CvBridge
import csv
import numpy as np

class DepthDataToCSV(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('depth_data_to_csv')
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
            Image,
            '/camera/depth/image_rect_raw',
            self.listener_callback,
            10)
        self.bridge = CvBridge()
        self.csv_file = open('depth_data.csv', 'w', newline='')
        self.writer = csv.writer(self.csv_file)
        self.writer.writerow(["x", "y", "depth"])

        print(self.csv_file)

    def listener_callback(self, msg):
        cv_image = self.bridge.imgmsg_to_cv2(msg, desired_encoding='passthrough')
        # Example: Writing every 10th pixel in a grid to reduce data size
        for i in range(0, cv_image.shape[0], 10):
            for j in range(0, cv_image.shape[1], 10):
                depth = cv_image[i, j]
                self.writer.writerow([i, j, depth])

    def destroy_node(self):
        self.csv_file.close()
        super().destroy_node()

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = DepthDataToCSV()
    try:
        rclpy.spin(node)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Save and close the file by using `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, and finally `Ctrl+X`.

#### 3. **Setup Entry Point**:
   - Modify the `setup.py` to include the entry point for the ROS 2 executable.
   ```bash
   cd ..
   nano setup.py
   ```
   - Add the following entry under `console_scripts` in the `entry_points` field:
   ```python
   'console_scripts': [
       'depth_to_csv = realsense_exporter.depth_to_csv:main',
   ],
   ```

### Build and Run the Node

#### 4. **Build the Package**:
   - Compile the package using `colcon` from the root of your ROS workspace.
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   colcon build --packages-select realsense_exporter
   ```

#### 5. **Source the Workspace**:
   - Ensure the workspace build artifacts are sourced.
   ```bash
   . install/setup.bash
   ```

#### 6. **Run the Node**:
   - Execute the node to start exporting depth data to the CSV file.
   ```bash
   ros2 run realsense_exporter depth_to_csv
   ```

### Verification

#### 7. **Verify Topic Subscription**:
   - With the node still running, open a new terminal tab.
   - Check if the node is subscribing to the correct depth image topic.
   ```bash
   ros2 topic list
   ```
   Look for `/camera/camera/depth/image_rect_raw`
   ```bash
   ros2 topic echo /camera/camera/depth/image_rect_raw
   ```

### Conclusion

This setup provides a complete workflow for capturing depth data from a RealSense camera and exporting it to a CSV file format using a custom ROS 2 node. Each pixel's x, y coordinates and depth value are recorded, allowing for detailed analysis and visualization outside of ROS environments.

## Exporting Depth Data to CSV File Format IN MATRIX FORM 

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake depth_to_csv
```
Add the following dependencies to the `package.xml` file
```bash
<exec_depend>rclpy</exec_depend>
<exec_depend>sensor_msgs</exec_depend>
<exec_depend>opencv</exec_depend>
<exec_depend>numpy</exec_depend>
```
Create a new Python Script in the `depth_to_csv` package 
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/depth_to_csv
touch depth_to_csv.py
```
Add the following code: 
```bash
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from sensor_msgs.msg import Image
import cv2
import numpy as np
import csv

class DepthToCSV(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('depth_to_csv')
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
            Image,
            '/camera/camera/depth/image_rect_raw',
            self.listener_callback,
            10)
        self.csv_file = open('depth.csv', 'w')
        self.csv_writer = csv.writer(self.csv_file)
        self.csv_writer.writerow(['x', 'y', 'depth'])

    def listener_callback(self, msg):
        depth_image = np.frombuffer(msg.data, dtype=np.uint16)
        depth_image = np.reshape(depth_image, (msg.height, msg.width))
        depth_image = cv2.normalize(depth_image, None, alpha=0, beta=255, norm_type=cv2.NORM_MINMAX, dtype=cv2.CV_8U)
        depth_image = cv2.applyColorMap(depth_image, cv2.COLORMAP_JET)
        depth_image = cv2.cvtColor(depth_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
        depth_image = cv2.flip(depth_image, 1)
        depth_image = cv2.resize(depth_image, (640, 480))
        depth_image = np.reshape(depth_image, (480, 640, 3))
        for i in range(480):
            for j in range(640):
                self.csv_writer.writerow([j, i, depth_image[i, j, 0]])
        self.csv_file.flush()

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = DepthToCSV()
    rclpy.spin(node)
    node.csv_file.close()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
Build the package
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
```
Source the workspace
```bash
. install/setup.bash
```
Run the script 
```bash
ros2 run depth_to_csv depth_to_csv.py
```
Stop the script and then verify the CSV file 
```bash
cat depth.csv
```
The CSV file should contain the depth data in a matrix format, where the rows and columns are the x and y coordinates of a 2D plane, and the values in each respective cell are the depth value readings at that pixel.
