# Install Intel RealSense ROS2 wrapper

  

#### Install from source
  
  - Create a ROS2 workspace
```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
```
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/
```
  
  - Clone the latest ROS2 Intel RealSense  wrapper from [here](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros.git) into '~/ros2_ws/src/'
```bashrc
git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros.git -b ros2-development
```
```bashrc
cd ~/ros2_ws
```
  
  - Install dependencies
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-rosdep -y
```
```bash
sudo rosdep init # "sudo rosdep init --include-eol-distros" for Foxy and earlier
```
```bash
rosdep update # "sudo rosdep update --include-eol-distros" for Foxy and earlier
```
```bash
rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO --skip-keys=librealsense2 -y
```

  - Build
```bash
colcon build
```

  -  Source environment
```bash
ROS_DISTRO=foxy
```
```bash
source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash
```
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
```
```bash
. install/local_setup.bash
```

## Automating Environment Setup in Bash

To streamline your workflow and avoid the need to manually source your ROS environment and workspace setup every time you open a new terminal, you can add the source commands directly to your `~/.bashrc` file. This setup ensures that your ROS environment is automatically prepared whenever you start a terminal.

### Steps to Modify the `~/.bashrc` File

#### 1. **Open the `~/.bashrc` File**:
   - Use a text editor to open the `~/.bashrc` file located in your home directory. You can use `gedit` or any other text editor of your choice:
   ```bash
   gedit ~/.bashrc
   ```

#### 2. **Add the Source Commands**:
   - Scroll to the end of the file and add the following lines to automatically source your ROS distribution and workspace:
   ```bash
   # Automatically source ROS 2 environment
   source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
   source ~/ros2_ws/install/local_setup.bash
   ```
   - Replace `foxy` with your ROS 2 version if different, and adjust the path to your workspace if it is not `~/ros2_ws`.

#### 3. **Save and Close the File**:

#### 4. **Apply the Changes**:
   - To ensure the changes take effect, either close and reopen your terminal or source the `.bashrc` file manually in any open terminals:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

With these additions to your `~/.bashrc` file, your ROS environment and workspace setup will automatically be sourced every time you open a new terminal window, eliminating the need to manually execute these commands. This automation helps in maintaining consistency across your work sessions and reduces setup time.

# Usage

## Start the camera node
  
  #### with ros2 run:
    ros2 run realsense2_camera realsense2_camera_node
    #or
    ros2 run realsense2_camera realsense2_camera_node --ros-args -p enable_color:=false -p spatial_filter.enable:=true -p temporal_filter.enable:=true
  
  #### with ros2 launch:
    ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py
    ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py depth_module.depth_profile:=1280x720x30 pointcloud.enable:=true

The command `ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py` initiates the ROS 2 launch file responsible for starting the RealSense camera node within a ROS 2 environment. This launch file is part of the `realsense2_camera` package, which provides a bridge between the Intel RealSense SDK and ROS 2 functionalities. When executed, this command performs several key actions:

- **Initializes the RealSense Camera**: It sets up the connected RealSense camera, configuring it based on the parameters specified within the launch file or default settings. This includes camera resolution, frame rate, and specific features like depth and color streaming.

- **Starts Data Publishing**: The launch script enables the camera to begin publishing data on various ROS topics. This data typically includes depth images, color images, infrared images, and other sensor outputs depending on the camera model and configuration.

- **Sets Up ROS Topics**: It establishes a set of ROS topics through which the data from the camera is made available. For example, depth data might be published on a topic like `/camera/depth/image_rect_raw`, allowing other ROS nodes to subscribe to and process this data.

- **Configures Additional Features**: Depending on the parameters and arguments provided, the launch file can also set up additional functionalities such as point cloud generation, data alignment, and filtering options that enhance the usability of the camera data within ROS 2 applications.
    ### This is basically the foundation of collecting data from the camera
